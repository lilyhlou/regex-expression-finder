# regex-expression-finder
This is a program created by Lily Lou and Taylor Montgomery for COMP 590: Little Languages. The purpose of the program is to  be able to read in regular expressions from a given string. The program is being read from the main.rs file and makes use of a parser and tokenizer, adapted from previous problem sets. The parser reads in tokens (converted from input through the tokenizer) and returns an AST enum or an error message if it is not accepted by the language. Taylor and Lily both worked on the main method, Lily worked on the tokenizer and Taylor wrote tests for tokenizer. For the parser, Lily worked on the RegExpr, Catenation, Closure and Atom methods. Taylor worked on tests for parser. Collaboration was done through pair programming and GitHub.
